FitBitBot:

Project Healthbot

Our project aimed to address overall mental health and well-being as reflected by the quantity and quality of sleep. Project Health bot is a Facebook messenger chatbot that was supposed to be conncected to the Fitbit system. After a week of data collected by the Fitbit, the chatbot would have extracted sleep data from Fitbit through a program coded in python. From there, the data would be analyzed and contrasted against what is known as the appropriate amount of sleep for a week. The chatbot would then talk to the user about their week. If the user had less than the recommemded amount of sleep, the chatbot would have asked for reasons why and focused on the aspect of stress. The overall point of the Health Bot was to allow users to understand the importance of sleep (relative to their own sleeping patterns and habits) and to understand the effect of sleep on stress.
